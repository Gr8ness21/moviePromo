    <h3>Novel Origin:
        Ready Player One is a 2011 science fiction novel, and the debut novel of American author Ernest Cline. The
        story, set in a dystopia in 2044, follows protagonist Wade Watts on his search for an Easter egg in a
        worldwide virtual reality game, the discovery of which will lead him to inherit the game creator's fortune.
        Cline sold the rights to publish the novel in June 2010, in a bidding war to the Crown Publishing Group (a
        division of Random House). The book was published on August 16, 2011. An audiobook was released the same day; it
        was narrated by Will Wheaton, who was mentioned briefly in one of the chapters. In 2012, the book received
        an Alex Award from the Young Adult Library Services Association division of the American Library Association and
        won the 2012 Prometheus Award.
        A film adaptation, screen-written by Cline and Zak Penn and directed by Steven Spielberg, was released on March
        29, 2018.</h3>

    <h3>Ready Player One is a 2018 American science fiction adventure film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg,
        and written by Zak Penn and Ernest Cline, based on Cline's 2011 novel of the same name. The film stars Tye
        Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg, and Mark Rylance. The film takes
        place in 2045, when much of humanity uses the virtual reality software OASIS
        (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation) to escape the desolation of the real world.
        Orphaned teenager Wade Watts (Sheridan) discovers clues to a hidden game within the program that promises the
        winner full ownership of the OASIS, and joins several allies to try to complete the game before a large company
        run by businessman Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn) can do so.
        Ready Player One premiered at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas on March 11, 2018, was theatrically released
        by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on March 29, 2018, in 2D, Real D 3D, IMAX and IMAX 3D. It grossed
        over $582 million and received generally positive reviews; critics praised its visuals, brisk pacing, the
        performances of Sheridan and Rylance, and the many cultural references from various media. The film was noted to
        have significant differences from the book; some critics said the film's plot was an improvement over the source
        material. It also received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.</h3>

    <h3>The movie is heavily influenced by pop culture, video games, movies, shows, cartoons, and comics from the 70s
        and 80s. I sincerely loved the way they managed to incorporate all of these things in a cohesive way to create
        this visually stunning movie.

        In the movie, the protagonist Wade is one of many people trying to win a contest designed by James Halliday a
        genius and creator of the Oasis. The contest consists of 3 challenges and the first to complete all 3 challenges
        will win 500Billion dollars - the entire company.

        Wade is joined by 4 other gamers who eventually team up to battle against a rival company seeking to claim the
        money and oasis for themselves.
